The 'Run_analysis.R' script will provide two tables:

- completetable with all observations of the  measurements on
 the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

- tableofaverages with the average of the  measurements on  the mean and
 standard deviation for each measurement for each activity and each subject
 
 Both tables have 68 columns. Below follows a description of each column
